# The Ground Station

## A series of papers relating to package management within the hardware development ecosystem.

This is a collection of thoughts and ideas on how to think of, design, and implement a package manager for hardware description languages (HDL). Read [motion 0x01](./motion0x01.md) for an introduction and rationale.

The motive is to map out thoughts and ideas in a clear and comprehensive manner to potentially receive feedback and be a reference when designing and implementing the package manager tool.

The papers are organized as _motions_, highlighting that they are proposals open to discussion and review.
